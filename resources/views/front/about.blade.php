        <h3 class="text-center font-stripe-thin fw-300">About Slade</h3>
        <p>Here at Slade we create websites and brands for other businesses, helping
            promote their products and company itself. The members of Slade are a
            variation of different expertise, from free-lance designers to web
            developers.
            We set to impress and satisfy our customers as much as we possibly can. Our
            aim is to make sure that other businesses and companies are receiving the
            services they deserve.
            We always give our best attention to detail to every project we do. We aim
            to give the best service for the best price. We will architect a design
            around <b>you</b>.</p>
        <p>Slade was founded by Nathan Connor and Jack Holden, two prodigies that came
            together to revise the face of the internet world.
            The 2 backgrounds of Jack and Nathan we’re too well not to work together,
            with Nathans creative and coding motivation and Jacks technical lead
            they’ve brought both their skills into one package.
            Jack and Nathan have worked on many other projects in the past with both
            some being unsuccessful and some being successful.
            They’ve put all their ideas into one whole package and brought together
            Slade. We strive to give the best possible development and service for our
            clients</p>
